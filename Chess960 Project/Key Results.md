# Key Results

## Main Finding

Players perform significantly worse in Chess960 openings (moves 1-12), and this gap reflects the loss of preparation capital — not position difficulty.

## Result 1: Format Gap

`mean(log(CPL+1))` is **+0.18** higher in Chess960 (p < 0.001).

After [[Start-Position Fixed Effects]]: gap = +0.10 (41% reduction, 59% survives).

## Result 2: Prep Capital Interaction (theta3)

From [[Two-Rating Decomposition]]:
- theta3 = **+0.050**** — standard rating is less predictive in Chess960
- **Opening-specific**: theta3 vanishes in middlegame and endgame
- Consistent across rating sources (API, PGN median, PGN first-observed)

## Result 3: Gelbach Channels

From [[Gelbach Decomposition]]:
- **Bishops** are the largest single contributor (15.4% of gap)
- Knights *help* when displaced (-6.2%)
- **64.3% residual** = pure template-absence effect
- Clock state explains only 1.1%

## Result 4: Player Heterogeneity

From [[Random Slopes & BLUPs]]:
- Players with high prep rent (R_std >> R_960) have the largest format gaps (r = +0.229***)
- 960 specialists and diverse-repertoire players show smaller gaps

## Result 5: Complexity Is Not a Confound

From [[Complexity Analysis]]:
- Chess960 positions are slightly *less* complex (lower complexity_1v2)
- Format effect persists (+9.1 cp) after full complexity controls
- `share_good_top5` is the strongest complexity predictor

## Result 6: Robustness

From [[Robustness Checks]]:
- 7 alternative DVs all show the same pattern
- Quarterly stability: no attenuation 2020-2024
- Experience cohorts: gap = ~0.14 across all cohorts, no convergence
- FE vs RE: equivalent specifications
