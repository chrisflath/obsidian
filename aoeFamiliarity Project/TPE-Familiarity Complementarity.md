# TPE-Familiarity Complementarity

## Research Question

Do TPE and Familiarity interact? Does prior shared experience amplify the value of coordination skill?

## Triple Interaction Model

```
win ~ selo + tpe + fam + tpe*fam + (tier interactions)
```

## Main Result

**Overall TPE x Familiarity interaction: 0.030*** (highly significant)**

This means: teams with BOTH high TPE and high familiarity outperform what either factor alone would predict. Coordination skill and relationship capital are **complements**, not substitutes.

## By Elo Tier

| Elo Tier | TPE x Fam Interaction | Significance |
|----------|----------------------|--------------|
| Q1 (Low) | 0.021*** | Significant |
| Q4 (High) | 0.040*** | Significantly stronger (p<0.001) |

## Interpretation

The complementarity is **strongest at high Elo** (0.040 vs 0.021):

1. At high skill levels, margins between teams are tighter
2. Teammate-specific learning has the **highest ROI** when coordination is already valued
3. High-Elo players can better *leverage* familiarity because they have the baseline coordination skill to build on

This suggests a "skill threshold" for familiarity benefits: you need coordination ability *first*, then familiarity amplifies it. Without coordination skill, shared experience has diminishing returns.

## Organizational Implication

This maps to the finding in management research that team tenure (familiarity) benefits are conditional on team members' underlying collaborative capacity. Simply keeping teams together isn't enough -- the team needs members who can coordinate effectively.
