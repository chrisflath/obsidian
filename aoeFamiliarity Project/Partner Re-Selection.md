# Partner Re-Selection

Part of [[aoeFamiliarity Project]] | Behavioral Validation

**Script:** `id_partner_selection.py`

## Logic

If coordination skill is real and perceived by players, they should **preferentially re-team with high-TPE partners** -- a revealed preference test.

## Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| High-TPE partner re-co-play rate | 26.1% |
| Baseline re-co-play rate | 20.5% |
| **Rate ratio** | **1.27x** |
| Stratum FE model | +2.3 pp per 1 SD TPE |
| p-value | < 10^-138 |

## Belief Updating

The analysis also tests for belief updating through a **TPE x First Win interaction**:
- Players who win with a high-TPE partner are even more likely to re-select them
- Consistent with Bayesian updating: initial positive experience reinforces the preference

## Interpretation

Players **perceive and act on** coordination skill, even when they cannot explicitly articulate it. This is behavioral validation of the TPE construct -- it captures something real that participants in the system respond to.

## Organizational Parallel

This mirrors the "repeat collaboration" phenomenon in organizations: people seek out colleagues who are "good to work with" beyond their technical credentials. The 27% premium in re-selection suggests coordination skill creates measurable relationship value.

## What This Adds

While statistical tests (coefficients, p-values) show TPE predicts outcomes, this test shows that **agents in the system recognize it**. It moves from "does TPE matter?" to "do people know TPE matters?" -- a stronger form of validation.
