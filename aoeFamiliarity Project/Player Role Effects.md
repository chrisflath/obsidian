# Player Role Effects

## AoE2 Team Positions

In team games, players are assigned positional roles:
- **Flank:** Outer positions, typically engage in early aggression and defense
- **Pocket:** Inner/center positions, typically boom economy and provide late-game support

See [[Terminology Glossary]] for more context.

## Results

**Finding:** Minimal difference between positions

- TPE difference between Pocket and Flank: **1.6%**
- p-value: **0.60** (not significant)

## Interpretation

Both positions require coordination, but the *type* of coordination differs:
- **Flank** players need to coordinate defensive walls and early aggression timing
- **Pocket** players need to coordinate resource allocation and late-game army composition

The similar TPE importance suggests that coordination skill is **generalizable across roles** -- good coordinators are good in any position, not just their "specialty."

This supports the interpretation of TPE as a transferable trait rather than a position-specific skill.
